\chapter*{Abstract}

Social coding platforms like GitHub make development and contribution workflow data publicly available. Through process mining three Git repositories, this thesis investigates the impact of contribution guidelines and the resulting workflows, on code quality. Thereby \acp{ocel} are used, as this format provides different viewpoints allowing a high flexibility during analysis. Thus the event log acts as both the ground truth for visualizing code quality and the workflow perspective. The author finds that contribution guidelines impact code quality significantly and that obeying contribution guidelines tends to improve code quality.
