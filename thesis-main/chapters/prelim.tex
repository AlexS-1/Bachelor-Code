\section{Choice and Definition of Code Quality Metrics}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Definition cyclomatic complexity: How many conditional branches does method, file or class have, by using running example
	\item Definition maintainability index using running example: Chosen version and relation to Halstead's complexity measures using running example
	\item Explanation \emph{PyLint} score: Linting and variable names using running example
	\item Definition of method length, file length, variable name length, line length among other line number related code quality metrics
\end{itemize}

\section{Definition of Contribution}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Based on GitHub definition, but changed meaning for context of this thesis
\end{itemize}

\section{Definitions of \ac{ocpm}-Related Terms}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Viewpoint using running example
	\item Event vs.\ activity vs.\ event type using running example
