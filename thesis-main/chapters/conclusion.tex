\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{chap:conclusion}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Power of \ac{ocel} and \ac{ocpm} to unify multiple viewpoints reducing overhead for extraction
	\item Effect of different contribution guidelines on code quality is hard to quantify, but visible in results
	\item Positive code quality evolution in investigated repositories with larger improvements after contribution guideline changes
\end{itemize}

\section{Future Work}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Use further code quality metrics to investigate impact of guideline changes on specific code quality aspects
	\item Implement interactive code quality visualizer for user-friendly filtering of viewpoints and time frames
	\item Analyzing contribution workflows for different programming languages
\end{itemize}
