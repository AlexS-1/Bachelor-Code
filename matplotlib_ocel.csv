There seem to be a conflict, please backport manually. Here are approximate instructions:

1. Checkout backport branch and update it.

```
git checkout v3.10.x
git pull
```

2. Cherry pick the first parent branch of the this PR on top of the older branch:
```
git cherry-pick -x -m1 efacc7d26c2d378deb097349bd4051ed4bd29032
```

3. You will likely have some merge/cherry-pick conflict here, fix them and commit:

```
git commit -am 'Backport PR #30333: FIX: cast Patch linewidth to float for dash scaling'
```

4. Push to a named branch:

```
git push YOURFORK v3.10.x:auto-backport-of-pr-30333-on-v3.10.x
```

5. Create a PR against branch v3.10.x, I would have named this PR:

> ""Backport PR #30333 on branch v3.10.x (FIX: cast Patch linewidth to float for dash scaling)""

And apply the correct labels and milestones.

Congratulations — you did some good work! Hopefully your backport PR will be tested by the continuous integration and merged soon!

Remember to remove the `Still Needs Manual Backport` label once the PR gets merged.

If these instructions are inaccurate, feel free to [suggest an improvement](https://github.com/MeeseeksBox/MeeseeksDev).

Thanks for your work on this @leakyH.  ~Currently it is not quite right because it fixes the bound you didn't set and prevents further automatic updates to it.~  Adapting your example:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Sample data
x = np.linspace(10, 20, 100)
y = np.sin(x)

fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.plot(x, y)
ax.spines['bottom'].set_bounds(10, None)
ax.plot(x*2, y)
plt.show()

```
with your branch, this now gives
<img width=""640"" height=""480"" alt=""image"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cc68945b-4df7-46b9-925b-80938954999f"" />

~But the x-spine should go from 10 to the x-axis upper limit.~

I also note that `Spine.get_bounds` is public API and [we are quite strict about making changes to the behaviour of that](https://matplotlib.org/devdocs/devel/api_changes.html#deprecate-api).  It can be done, but as you see from the guidelines there are various aspects to weigh up.

I wonder if the issue might be fixed more simply by only changing the way `low` and `high` are defined in `_adjust_location`.  Currently it uses the viewlim if neither bound was set.  If one element of `self._bounds` is `None`, could we just replace that element with the relevant element of the viewlim?"
IC_kwDOABUios64OJ5d,comment_pull_request,2025-07-18T21:05:24Z,leakyH,commented-by,30330,on-pull-request,,,comment,"yes @rcomer , thank you for your inspiring review, and I know what you mean now.
1. In your demo,  the viewLim changes after manually `set_bounds()`, so the spine does not align with the viewLim. You expect that when `set_bounds(10, None)`, the **None** should refer to an automatic/default behaviour, which is to extend to axis's upper/lower limit, a.k.a. viewLim. I need to remind you that this is slightly different from the documentation, which says
> Passing None leaves the limit unchanged.

Certainly, we can change the documentation after all. I just want to make sure you notice that and this is what we want. Since this `set_bounds()` API did not work in the past, maybe this behaviour change is acceptable.

As a reference, please run this code:
```
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Sample data
x = np.linspace(10, 20, 100)
y = np.sin(x)

fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.plot(x, y)
# ax.spines['bottom'].set_bounds(10, None)
ax.set_xlim(10, None)# Note this
ax.plot(x*2, y)
plt.savefig('modify_after_set.jpg')
```
You'll see the **None** for xlim also means to keep the original xlim, and does not change for later `ax.plot`.

2. As you said, I will think of a simpler modification and try to keep `get_bounds()` returning the internal object `self._bounds`.


I think the easiest way is to modify the `_adjust_location`, and allow the spine to automatically extend to axis's upper/lower limit. But it would be better to clarify what we want before further modifications to the code.

Thank you!

1. `get_bounds()` now returns the internal object `self._bounds` as it did.
2. In `set_bounds()`, it gets the original bounds as `_adjust_location` did, so the logic is extracted as a function called `_get_bounds_or_viewLim`. 

And to whom may concern, this PR initailly processed the `self._bounds is None` situation in the `get_bounds()` public API, which may bring extra complexity. Based on the feedback, now the `set_bounds` and `_adjust_location` both use the internal function `_get_bounds_or_viewLim`."

I would not generally expect to see a test added with a typing change.  In this case, I am in two minds whether to keep it.  On one hand, test coverage is in general a good thing and this particular test is not expensive.  On the other hand, the method in question is so simple that it is hard to see how it could go wrong, and there are existing tests that exercise it within `test_legend.py` (although they are targeting other functionality)."

I initially attempted to address multiple points from this issue in a single PR, but I realized that it introduced unnecessary complexity, especially for someone like me who is still learning and new to contributing at this scale.

To manage things better and ensure clarity in both review and implementation, I’ve now shifted to handling one fix at a time. I’ve started with set_loglevel as it seemed like a simpler, self-contained change to begin with.

This approach will also help me improve gradually and avoid making mistakes across unrelated parts. Thank you so much for your patience and guidance, it’s really encouraging for a beginner like me 🙏🙂"

However, implementation-wise we've accepted any capitalization, in particular also thd capitalized form ""INFO"", which is passed through to/accepted by stdlibs `Logger.setLevel` - maybe we should take the opportunity to align more with the stdlib?"

I’ll take a closer look at the color resolution logic, especially around how get_facecolor and get_edgecolor interact in these scenarios. As you noted, switching to or including get_edgecolor might resolve this more cleanly.

I’ve made the changes now. Specifically, I updated the logic to check for transparent or missing facecolors (like in outline scatter plots or step histograms) and fall back to using the edgecolor instead as you suggested. This should fix the issue with missing or incorrect legend label colors in those cases.

You can use the following script to visually confirm that the labels now pick up the expected colors across all four plot types:

Let me know if this works better now!

y = np.random.randn(1000)

1. I had to update the colour_getters logic and modify a few tests where the check was comparing the full color array. Since the updated logic uses the first valid color in some cases (like gradients or arrays), I updated those tests accordingly.
2. I’ve also added the ValueError handling to catch invalid labelcolor inputs like 'not-a-color'.
3. On top of that, I created several new test functions at the end to cover a wide range of edge cases, including transparent colors, None, mixed facecolors, missing labels, empty color arrays, etc.

I’ve tried to ensure everything is correct, but I might’ve missed something. Feel free to point it out if so!

However, I think that the buggy behaviour described in #30276 is a pretty narrow edge case.  So discussing it here in the docstring may just confuse the general user.

Also, with Matplotlib v3.10.3 I see the same behaviour whether I set the axis limits before or after setting the clip path.  Do you see different behaviours with another version?"
IC_kwDOABUios62qG0y,comment_pull_request,2025-07-12T01:47:30Z,Narender Singh,commented-by,30295,on-pull-request,,,comment,"Thanks for the feedback!

You're right — this is definitely an edge case and I understand the concern about overloading the docstring. I originally chose to document this because it came up in multiple discussions including #28717 and #30276, where users experienced misalignment after `set_clip_path()` with axis limit changes.

I tested this on Matplotlib versions:
- 3.8.2: Clipping breaks if `set_xlim()` is used *after* `set_clip_path()`.
- 3.10.3: Seems to behave more consistently (possibly fixed or improved?).

So this may indeed be version-dependent, or possibly backend/environment-specific.

Would it make sense to instead:
- Move this into a **note in the FAQ or examples gallery**, or
- Add a warning/example in a **tutorial or `axvspan`/annotation usage guide** rather than the `Annotation` docstring itself?

Open to suggestions on where it fits best — happy to revise or close if not suitable here."
IC_kwDOABUios62r5dg,comment_pull_request,2025-07-12T08:54:53Z,Ruth Comer,commented-by,30295,on-pull-request,,,comment,"Note that https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/28717 and https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/30276 were opened by the same person and one issue is explicitly a follow-up of the other.  Have you seen the problem come up elsewhere?

I think the work to do for #30276 is to establish what the correct behaviour should be and why I get different behaviour from the OP.  Questions about if, how and where it should be documented can come after that.
